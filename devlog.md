## Thoughts so far, Started the project
- Project needs three components: logger, encryption program, and driver program
- I am deciding to do this in python because it's the easiest way to do it and I;m confortable in python already
- Because it is python I have to use the Subprocess module
- All components will communicate with the use of pipes in Python's subprocess module
- Logger needs to formatted in a certain way for this thing to come out correctly.
- We probably need to format some the messages and stuff.
- We need the current time so we need to use the datetime lib in python.
- Need to ensure proper error handling and file management with try catch so we handle IOExceptions gracefully.

## Plan for this session
1. Check the git repository setup again
2. Download the required python files from blackboard
1. Learn about the functions and how to implement this logger
2. Implement the logger code
3. Test the logger and see if it's valid
4. Plan next steps for encryption program

## Session Progress
- Implemented basic logger program with timestamp formatting
- Testing logging functionality with sample messages, works great!
- Verifying proper file handling and QUIT behavior, perfect!
- Had some problems understanding the datetime functions and had to research how the argv stuff works for command line arguments
- Push the code up to remote
